# Speed Typing Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Speed Typing Test! This simple console-based application allows users to test their typing speed by typing a randomly selected piece of text. The application calculates and displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure to install the required module:

```bash
pip install windows_curses
```

## How to Run

Simply execute the script, and the Speed Typing Test will begin. Press any key to start typing the displayed text. Once you complete the text, your typing speed in WPM will be shown.

## Features

- Displays a welcome screen prompting the user to press any key to start the test.
- Randomly selects a piece of text from the provided `text.txt` file.
- Dynamically updates the display with the current input, the target text, and the calculated WPM.
- Uses color-coded characters to indicate correct and incorrect typing.
- Allows users to backspace if they make a mistake.
- Completing the text displays a message to press any key to continue or exit the application.

## Notes

- Press the Escape key (Esc) to exit the application at any time.

Feel free to customize the `text.txt` file with your preferred texts for an enjoyable typing experience!

**Happy Typing!**
